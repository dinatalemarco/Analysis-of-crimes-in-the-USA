# Analysis-of-crimes-in-the-USA

With this project we analyzed the crime situation in the USA, to then make a predictive study. In particular, the study focuses on the city with the most crimes, where predictions 
were made on where a certain type of crime is most likely to occur, the ethnicity, sex and age of the person who is most likely to be a victim of this crime, and other. 
The study was done:
- using Python in particular using the NumPy and Pandas libraries,
- the datasets were taken from the FBI website
